## 10/06/2020 Week 41 üèÄ Women's College Basketball 
[**Code**](https://github.com/schmid07/TidyTuesday_Weekly_Data_Viz_Challenge/blob/main/Code/2020_41_bball.R)

The below plot was created using the `gt` package and was adapted from a chart in Neil Paine's [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/louisiana-tech-was-the-uconn-of-the-80s/) on women's college basketball dynasties (see second table below). I originally submitted this as part of TidyTuesday and later submitted it as part of the November 2020 [RStudio Table Contest](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/12/23/winners-of-the-2020-rstudio-table-contest/). For anyone getting started with `gt`, I'd recommend Tom Mock's [tutorial](https://themockup.blog/static/gt-cookbook.html) on his blog. I also found Georgios Karamanis' week 40/2020 [post](https://github.com/gkaramanis/tidytuesday/tree/master/2020-week40) very helpful in getting started with `gt`.

I recently adapted the below table using the `reactable`, `crosstalk`, and `reactblefmtr` packages. See code and interactive table [here](https://github.com/schmid07/R-Reactable).
