The below plot was adapted from a chart in Neil Paine's [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/louisiana-tech-was-the-uconn-of-the-80s/) on women's college basketball dynasties. I originally submitted this as part of tidytuesday and later submitted as part of [R Studio Table Contest](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/12/23/winners-of-the-2020-rstudio-table-contest/)
